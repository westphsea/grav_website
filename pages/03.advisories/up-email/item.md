The University of the Philippines, through the eUP Program, has created a new system-wide email service. The plan is to provide email addresses for all UP students and employees. Using the email domain name of @up.edu.ph, these eUP email addresses will be used by students and employees in accessing the information services to be provided by eUP.

The new eUP e-mail service provides users 30 GB of mailbox space each and allows use of other Google services, such as Gmail, Google+, Google Drive, Google Hangout, and Google Groups using the UP account.

The eUP email account is different from the UP Manila email service (@post.upm.edu.ph). The user has the option to utilize both accounts for email purposes. But for eUP purposes, the eUP email using @up.edu.ph must be used for authentication purposes.

eUP has provided the initial list of email addresses for UP Manila students and employees and PGH employees. The email addresses will be distributed to the users through:
OUR for students
HRDO for UP Manila emloyees
HRDD for PGH employees

Users can activate their account by logging in at http://google.com/a/up.edu.ph or http://mail.up.edu.ph.

Please change your provided temporary password after activating the account.

The list provided by eUP is incomplete. The email accounts for some employees and students (especially freshmen) have not been created yet. UP Manila will coordinate with the eUP to resolve this issue.

Please email Eryn Yuson of IMS if you have issues and questions regarding eUP email service.
